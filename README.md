}
```

Base Requirements:

- Clean, readable, maintainable codebase
- Source code on Github or Bitbucket
- Cross browser support (or graceful degradation)
- Responsive design and implementation, you can use a CSS Framework/
- A good user experience
- You must implement the function `randomNumber(n)` function that generates a random number greater than or equal to 0, and less than input *n*.
- *n* must be greater than 0.
- *n* must be less than 1,000,000.
- Your only source of randomness must be the provided `flip()` function.
- You cannot use `Math.random` in your implementation.
- You can use Google to figure out how to do this.
